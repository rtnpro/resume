At Transifex, I develop new features, enhance existing ones and implement
support for various i18n file formats. I also write tests to ensure that
things run as they are expected to. User support, bug triagging and bug
fixing are also part of my job. At Transifex, we innovate to take localization
to the next level. Below are a few things(among many) that I have done so
far at Transifex:

* Implement and enhance
  `file format
  <http://help.transifex.com/features/formats.html#user-formats>`_ handlers.
* Implemented `Glossary
  <http://help.transifex.com/features/glossary.html#glossaryv2>`_ feature.
* Implemented *related tag cloud*.
* Implemented `translation strings API
  <http://help.transifex.com/features/api/index.html#translation-strings>`_.
* Implemented `language management API
  <http://help.transifex.com/features/api/index.html#language-management>`_.
* Implemented a super fast test suite.
* Fix and update tests.
* Bug-triagging & bug-fixing.

Summer Intern at Transifex , June 2011 - August 2011 (3 months)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It was an awesome experience to work as an Intern at Indifex. I got introduced
to a plethora of new technologies all of a sudden. I went through a steep
learning curve and finally it paid off. I contributed to Transifex, increased
test coverage for Transifex, fixed bugs, added support for new i18n file
fomats. I also worked on implementing new features for Transifex, like,
Glossary, tag assignment, etc.

`Lossless secure transmission in Bluetooth scatternet, considering device
mobility, IEEE <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5940840&contentType=Conference+Publications&queryText%3DLossless+secure+transmission+in+Bluetooth+scatternet%2C+considering+device+mobility>`_

**Summary** ::

	In this paper, we propose an algorithm for lossless transmission of data in a Bluetooth scatternet
	taking into consideration the mobility of the devices. For this we use the scatternet formation and
	route maintenance algorithms proposed in “Location aware route maintenance protocols for mobile
	Ad Hoc networks”, which reconstructs optimal routes in a mobile Ad Hoc Bluetooth network. Our
	algorithm named Enhanced Mobility Aware Routing (EMOLAR) deals with secure data transmission
	during route reconstruction proposed in Location aware route maintenance protocols for mobile Ad
	Hoc networks.
