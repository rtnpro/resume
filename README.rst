Summary
-------
I am a Free and Open Source Software contributor and evangelist.
I am the creator and maintainer of Waartaa (https://www.waartaa.com),
an open source communication and collaboration tool for humans. I usually
make web apps using Python/Django, however, lately, I have been working a
lot with MeteorJS, for building Waartaa, and Ansible for provisioning
servers for Waartaa. When I am not working on Waartaa, I also contribute
to The FedoraProject and Mozilla. I work at https://www.goibibo.com as a
Senior Software Engineer. At work, I write intuitive, maintainable,
scalable web apps using Python/Django. In my free time, I get my hands
dirty with some devops stuffs, as well.

Software Developer and QA at Transifex , September 2011 – January 2013
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At Transifex, I developed new features, enhanced existing ones and implemented
support for various i18n file formats. I also wrote tests to ensure that
things run as they are expected to. User support, bug triagging and bug
fixing were also part of my job. At Transifex, we constantly innovated to
take localization to the next level. Below are a few things(among many)
that I had worked on at Transifex:

* Implemented and enhanced
  `file format
  <http://help.transifex.com/features/formats.html#user-formats>`_ handlers.
* Implemented `Glossary
  <http://docs.transifex.com/guides/glossary>`_ feature.
* Implemented *related tag cloud*.
* Implemented `translation strings API
  <http://docs.transifex.com/developer/api/translation_strings>`_.
* Implemented `languages API
  <http://docs.transifex.com/developer/api/languages>`_.
* Implemented a super fast test suite.
* Fixed and updated tests.
* Bug-triagging & bug-fixing.
* Handled user queries and bug reports at
  `support.transifex.com <support.transifex.com>`_ and over live chat
  at `Transifex <www.transifex.com>`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Summer Intern at Transifex , June 2011 - August 2011 (3 months)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It was an awesome experience to work as an Intern at Transifex. I got
introduced to a plethora of new technologies all of a sudden. I went
through a steep learning curve and finally it paid off. I contributed
to Transifex, increased test coverage for Transifex, fixed bugs,
added support for new i18n file fomats. I also worked on implementing
new features for Transifex, like, Glossary, tag assignment, etc.
